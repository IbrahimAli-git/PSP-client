Professional Software Projects

Project Descripton

For the software projects module we have been tasked with designing and building an application for our clients. Our clients who are MTa immersion are a professional organisation that serves people who are interested in experiential education. Their target audience includes "faculty, staff, administrators, and students in higher education, as well as K-12 educators, youth development professionals, corporate trainers, and outdoor educators." 

In terms of software this has been detailed in the clientâ€™s specification. It can be split into frontend and backend. For the frontend, the user interface, the project specification states that MaterialUI is to be used. MaterialUI is a JavaScript framework which allows a developer to build a user interface. MaterialUI also works using the React.js framework internally. For multiple connections we have used Socket.io. This allows for multiple users to connect to out application from seperate computers. MongoDB with Nest.js and TypeScript to be used in connection with the database.
