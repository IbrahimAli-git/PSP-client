Professional Software Projects

Project Descripton

For the software projects module we have been tasked with designing and building an application for our clients. Our clients who are MTa immersion are a professional organisation that serves people who are interested in experiential education. Their target audience includes "faculty, staff, administrators, and students in higher education, as well as K-12 educators, youth development professionals, corporate trainers, and outdoor educators." 

In terms of software this has been detailed in the client’s specification. It can be split into frontend and backend. For the frontend, the user interface, the project specification states that MaterialUI is to be used. MaterialUI is a JavaScript framework which allows a developer to build a user interface. It uses a mixture of Next.js and TypeScript to produce the final product. MaterialUI also works using the React.js framework internally. This should be downloaded on one’s computer as well as downloading and installing both JavaScript and TypeScript. For the backend, for connecting to the database, which allows a user’s data to be submitted and stored in a safe and organized manner the client’s specification states the database to be used is MongoDB with Nest.js and TypeScript to be used in connection with the database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database which allows for data to be stored in a non-relational manner. This should be installed on one’s local machine before beginning the project.
